# Nomie's Todo / Wishlist

## Things that should be built

### Easy to setup Nomie Sync Server
A way mere mortals can run a CouchDB server at home or in the cloud that they control.

### Chat Cloud App
A cloud app that is a chat server for a given tracker -
if you include your depression tracker, then you'd only be
connected to other people who selected their depression tracker.

### Track with Friends Cloud App

### Mac OS X and Windows Nomie Client
