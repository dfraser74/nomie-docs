## Nomie Tips!

Feel free to add your own!

#### Long Press Tracker Buttons...
Access quick actions for any tracker by pressing and holding.

#### Create your own trackers.
I originally forced users to create their own trackers - and while it wasn't super user friendly - it did you to examine what's important in your life.

#### Use #hashtags in #notes
Nomie will tag notes each time you use a #hashtag. See all the hashtag by clicking on the Search icon in the notes section.

#### Don't worry if your data isn't perfect.
The key with Nomie is to discover yourself, part of that discovery is how you'll force yourself to track. Don't worry if your data is inconsistent at first - focus instead on forming the habit of tracking and give yourself time - you'll find your patterns.
